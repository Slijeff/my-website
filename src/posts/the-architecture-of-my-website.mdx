# An Overview of My Website

## Contents

## Intro
When I was writing this, I was a month apart from starting my job as a Software Engineer at Geico.
Felling a bit bored, I decided to write a blog plus a website to document my journey, which should naturally
take me about one month to complete.

## The Stack
Since I'm most familiar with React, I wanted to use "plain" React at first (React + Vite). But I also wanted
something more performant since this is going to be content-heavy instead of focusing on reactivity, so I settled on Next.js, which supports
static-site-generation (SSG) and server-side-rendering (SSR).
