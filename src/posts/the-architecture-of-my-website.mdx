# An Overview of My Website

## Contents

## Intro
When I was writing this, I was a month apart from starting my job as a Software Engineer at Geico.
Felling a bit bored, I decided to write a blog plus a website to document my journey, which should naturally
take me about one month to complete. The source code of this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Slijeff/my-website).

## The Stack
### Framework
Since I'm most familiar with React, I wanted to use "plain" React at first (React + Vite). But I also wanted
something more performant since this is going to be content-heavy instead of focusing on reactivity, so I settled on Next.js, which supports
Static Site Generation (SSG), Server Side Rendering (SSR), and React Server Components (RSC). I was also considering
SSG frameworks such as Hugo or Astro, but it means that I have to learn
a whole new system that I'm not familiar with, which will be hard to debug when something goes wrong. 
### Packages
Other than React and Next, I also used [framer-motion](https://motion.dev/) for animations and [Material UI](https://mui.com) for UI components.

## The Structure
### Home and Contact
Those sections are pages without any dynamic content built using Next.js server components, which means the HTML
for those pages can directly be generated at build time. However, since I'm using Motion to animate my Home page's text,
if you look at the preview of downloaded HTML, you'll see blank text that have `opacity: 0`. Once the Motion Javascript is loaded, the text will be animated in.

import MarkdownImageWrapper from "@/components/markdownImageWrapper";
import html from "@/posts/images/website/pre-rendered-html.png";

<MarkdownImageWrapper image={html} caption="The pre-rendered HTML for Home. The animated cards in other sections are blank. The skills section is shown
because it doesn't have animation."/>

As you can see from the screenshot, the pre-rendered HTML has everything ready other than the interactive parts and the font to be downloaded.
The same applies for the Contact page.

### Blog
Since Next.js comes with support for markdown (MDX specifically), I used MDX to write my blog posts. For more details, please check out the Next.js
MDX [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx). I'll directly quote from the documentation:
> MDX is a superset of markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content.

The fact that all my blogs are rendered at build time, I was able to scan through all my blog posts using node's `fs` module and read their exported metadata to generate information
such as title, date, tags, and description. In the code below, notice how I could import the mdx file directly and get its metadata.

```ts showLineNumbers {7,8}
export const getAllPostsMeta = async (): Promise<PostMetadata[]> => {
  const posts = fs.readdirSync('./src/posts');
 
  const allPosts = posts
    .filter(post => post.endsWith('.mdx'))
    .map(async post => {
      const res = await import(`@/posts/${post}`);
      const metadata = res.metadata as Omit<
        PostMetadata,
        'slug' | 'filename' | 'readingTime'
      >;
      // abbreviated for brevity ...
    });

  return Promise.all(allPosts);
};
```
Besides supporting MDX, Next.js also allows using rehype and remark plugins in the markdown -> HTML process. For example, the table of contents on top is auto-generated
using the [rehype-toc](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc) plugin. Moreover, Next.js allows me to use a special file called `mdx-components.tsx` to control the styling
of each HTML element in the blog posts. For example, I can use MUI's Typography component to style paragraphs:
```tsx
export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
    return {
        // ...
        p: ({ children }) => (
        <Typography variant="body1" color="primary" lineHeight={1.5}>
            {children}
        </Typography>
        ),
        ...components
    }
}
```

The blog system does have some limitations. One of them being images. Right now the images are being stored in my source code repo, which means
that it could potentially take up a lot of space in GitHub once I have more blogs. And the current deployment method is to copy the source code
to a Next Docker and build it in the container, which means I can't separate the static files from the source code. More on that later in the deployment section.

### Archive
The archive is more like a bookmark manager, where I want to share some of my favorite blog posts and websites. To be able to do that, I obviously don't
want to update my source code every time I archive something new and rebuild then re-deploy. To solve this, I found something called [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/).
It is a bookmark manager that allows you to save links of your favorite websites into collections and share them with others. It also has a tag system that
I can manage and use to categorize my bookmarks. What's best is that they provide an API that allows me to query my bookmarks and render them in my website.
All the data fetching also happens at build time, so the archive is also pre-rendered at build time. Then, Next.js implements a technique called
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to update the archive when new bookmarks are added to Raindrop. In short, it allows you to set a revalidation timeout (e.g. 60 seconds).
After 60 seconds has passed, the next request will still show the cached (stale) page, however it will start fetching new data in the background. When the new data is ready,
the page will be rendered on the server with new data and the cache will be updated. Then when the user refreshes the page or when another user
access the page, they will see the updated page.
