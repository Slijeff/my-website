# An Overview of My Website

## Contents

## Intro
When I was writing this, I was a month apart from starting my job as a Software Engineer at Geico.
Felling a bit bored, I decided to write a blog plus a website to document my journey, which should naturally
take me about one month to complete. The source code of this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Slijeff/my-website).

## The Stack
### Framework
Since I'm most familiar with React, I wanted to use "plain" React at first (React + Vite). But I also wanted
something more performant since this is going to be content-heavy instead of focusing on reactivity, so I settled on Next.js, which supports
Static Site Generation (SSG), Server Side Rendering (SSR), and React Server Components (RSC). I was also considering
SSG frameworks such as Hugo or Astro, but it means that I have to learn
a whole new system that I'm not familiar with, which will be hard to debug when something goes wrong. 
### Packages
Other than React and Next, I also used [framer-motion](https://motion.dev/) for animations and [Material UI](https://mui.com) for UI components.

## The Structure
### Home and Contact Section
Those sections are pages without any dynamic content built using Next.js server components, which means the HTML
for those pages can directly be generated at build time. However, since I'm using Motion to animate my Home page's text,
if you look at the preview of downloaded HTML, you'll see blank text that have `opacity: 0`. Once the Motion Javascript is loaded, the text will be animated in.

import MarkdownImageWrapper from "@/components/markdownImageWrapper";
import html from "@/posts/images/website/pre-rendered-html.png";

<MarkdownImageWrapper image={html} caption="The pre-rendered HTML for Home. The animated cards in other sections are blank. The skill section is shown
because it doesn't have animation."/>

As you can see from the screenshot, the pre-rendered HTML has everything ready other than the interactive parts and the font to be downloaded.
